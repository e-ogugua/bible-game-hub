# Contributing to Bible Game Hub

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Bible Game Hub! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project in a way that maintains code quality, consistency, and the overall vision of the platform.

## Development Philosophy

Bible Game Hub is built with the following principles:

- **Accessibility First**: All features must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Performance Focused**: Code splitting, lazy loading, and optimization are priorities
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript with strict mode for reliability
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interactions that enhance the faith-based gaming experience

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git for version control
- Basic knowledge of React, TypeScript, and Next.js

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bible-game-hub.git
   cd bible-game-hub
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your development configuration
   ```

5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Run tests to ensure setup is working**:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run lint
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- Create feature branches from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
- Use descriptive branch names that clearly indicate the feature or fix
- Keep branches focused on a single feature or issue

### Commit Guidelines
Follow conventional commit messages:

```
feat: add new game mode selection
fix: resolve memory leak in 3D scenes
docs: update API documentation
style: improve button hover animations
refactor: optimize component structure
test: add accessibility tests
chore: update dependencies
```

### Code Standards

#### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript with explicit types
- Avoid `any` types - use proper interfaces and types
- Follow the existing type definitions in `src/types/`

#### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Include accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Follow the component patterns established in the codebase

#### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS with the established design system
- Follow responsive design patterns
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Ensure proper color contrast ratios

#### Performance
- Implement code splitting for new features
- Use React.lazy for route-based loading
- Optimize images and assets
- Monitor bundle sizes

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests
- Write tests for new components and utilities
- Use Jest and React Testing Library
- Aim for >80% code coverage for new code

#### Integration Tests
- Test complete user flows
- Verify accessibility features
- Test responsive behavior

#### Performance Tests
- Monitor bundle sizes
- Test loading performance
- Verify Core Web Vitals

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a pull request** with a clear title and description
2. **Reference any related issues** in the description
3. **Include screenshots** for UI changes
4. **Ensure all tests pass** before submitting
5. **Update documentation** if adding new features
