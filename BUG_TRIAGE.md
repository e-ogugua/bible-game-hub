# Bug Triage Sheet

## Overview

This document provides a systematic approach to triaging bugs and issues in the Bible Game Hub application. Issues are categorized by severity, impact, and resolution timeline.

## Severity Levels

### Critical (P0)
**Definition**: Issues that prevent core functionality or pose security risks
**Response Time**: Immediate (< 4 hours)
**Resolution Time**: < 24 hours
**Examples**:
- Application crashes or fails to load
- Security vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, data exposure)
- Complete loss of user data
- Payment processing failures
- Authentication bypass
- Service downtime affecting all users

### High (P1)
**Definition**: Significant issues affecting user experience or business operations
**Response Time**: < 8 hours
**Resolution Time**: < 3 business days
**Examples**:
- Major feature broken (games don't work, progress not saved)
- Performance issues causing 60fps violations
- Accessibility violations (WCAG AA failures)
- Incorrect game scoring or progression
- Mobile responsiveness completely broken
- High-frequency error rates (>5%)

### Medium (P2)
**Definition**: Issues affecting some users or features with workarounds available
**Response Time**: < 24 hours
**Resolution Time**: < 1 week
**Examples**:
- Minor UI/UX issues (button styling, layout problems)
- Performance optimizations needed
- Missing translations or content
- Browser compatibility issues
- Minor accessibility improvements
- Documentation gaps

### Low (P3)
**Definition**: Minor issues with minimal user impact
**Response Time**: < 48 hours
**Resolution Time**: < 2 weeks
**Examples**:
- Typographical errors
- Minor visual inconsistencies
- Enhancement requests
- Code quality improvements
- Test coverage additions

## Issue Categories

### Functionality
- Game mechanics not working as designed
- User progression not tracking correctly
- Feature requests for new functionality

### Performance
- Slow loading times (>3s for initial load)
- Frame rate drops below 60fps
- Bundle size exceeding limits
- Memory leaks or high resource usage

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA violations
- Keyboard navigation issues
- Screen reader compatibility problems
- Color contrast issues

### Compatibility
- Browser-specific bugs
- Mobile device issues
- Operating system compatibility
- Third-party integration problems

### Security
- Input validation issues
- Data exposure concerns
- Authentication weaknesses
- Compliance violations

## Triage Process

### 1. Initial Assessment
- **Reproduction**: Can the issue be consistently reproduced?
- **Impact**: How many users are affected?
- **Workaround**: Is there a temporary solution available?
- **Environment**: Browser, device, OS specifics

### 2. Severity Assignment
Based on the definitions above, assign appropriate severity level:
- Critical: Core functionality broken, security issues
- High: Major features broken, significant performance issues
- Medium: Minor issues with workarounds, UX improvements
- Low: Cosmetic issues, enhancements

### 3. Priority Assignment
Consider additional factors:
- **User Impact**: Number of affected users
- **Business Impact**: Revenue or growth implications
- **Technical Debt**: Long-term maintenance concerns
- **Regression Risk**: Potential for introducing new issues

### 4. Assignment & Timeline
- **Owner**: Assign to appropriate team member
- **ETA**: Set realistic resolution timeline
- **Dependencies**: Identify blocking issues or requirements

## Bug Report Template

### Issue Details
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive summary
- **Description**: Detailed reproduction steps
- **Expected Behavior**: What should happen
- **Actual Behavior**: What actually happens
- **Environment**: Browser, OS, device details

### Technical Details
- **Console Errors**: Any JavaScript errors
- **Network Requests**: Failed API calls or resources
- **Reproduction Steps**: Exact steps to reproduce
- **Screenshots**: Visual evidence when applicable

### Impact Assessment
- **Affected Users**: Estimated percentage or number
- **Frequency**: How often does this occur?
- **Workaround**: Is there a temporary solution?
- **Business Impact**: Revenue or user retention effects

## Resolution Workflow

### Investigation Phase
1. Reproduce the issue locally
2. Identify root cause
3. Assess potential solutions
4. Estimate development effort

### Implementation Phase
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Implement fix with tests
3. Verify accessibility compliance
4. Test across multiple browsers/devices

### Testing Phase
1. Unit tests for code changes
2. Integration tests for user flows
3. Accessibility testing
4. Performance regression testing

### Deployment Phase
1. Create pull request with detailed description
2. Code review by team members
3. Merge after approval
4. Deploy to staging for final testing

## Monitoring & Prevention

### Quality Gates
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Accessibility audits before release
- Performance monitoring in production
- Bundle size monitoring

### Proactive Measures
- Code reviews for all changes
- Regular accessibility audits
- Performance testing on various devices
- User feedback monitoring

## Common Issue Patterns

### Performance Issues
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor with `npm run analyze`
- **Loading Speed**: Use Lighthouse performance audit
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor in browser DevTools
- **Network Requests**: Check for unnecessary API calls

### Accessibility Issues
- **Color Contrast**: Use tools like WebAIM contrast checker
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Test tab order and shortcuts
- **Screen Readers**: Verify with NVDA or VoiceOver
- **Touch Targets**: Ensure 44px minimum size

### Mobile Issues
- **Touch Interactions**: Test gestures and scrolling
- **Viewport**: Verify responsive breakpoints
- **Performance**: Test on slower devices
- **Orientation**: Check landscape/portrait behavior

## Escalation Process

### When to Escalate
- Critical issues not resolved within SLA
- Multiple high-severity issues in backlog
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Performance degradation affecting all users

### Escalation Path
1. **Team Lead**: Technical guidance and prioritization
2. **Product Manager**: Business impact assessment
3. **Engineering Manager**: Resource allocation
4. **Executive Team**: Strategic decisions (if needed)

## Metrics & Reporting

### Weekly Metrics
- Issues resolved by severity level
- Average resolution time
- Open issues trend
- User satisfaction scores

### Monthly Reporting
- Quality improvements implemented
- Technical debt reduction
- Accessibility compliance status
- Performance optimization results
